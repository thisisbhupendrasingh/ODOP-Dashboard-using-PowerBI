### 🎯 Project Overview
In this dashboard, I’ve brought together data for all districts and their identified ODOP products till July 7, 2025 to provide a clear and interactive view of this initiative. The main objectives of this dashboard is to visualize each district’s unique product and its category to analyze the distribution of ODOP items across states and sectors.

It highlights each district’s unique product, its category, and the distribution across states, helping promote local industries and entrepreneurship.
